# cart-react-typescript

This program is a shopping cart built with ReactJS, Typescript, Material UI, Styled Components and React-Query.

To populate this fake shopping page I used the fakestore API, an open source software, to fill in the shop with dummy data. Users will be able to add items to the cart along with the option to change the number of items. 

This project is built using the freecodecamp tutorial, but I have made changes to make this project my own.
