# Shopping Cart

This is a shopping cart webpage that allows users to add or delete items from their cart. It utilizes the Fakestore API to populate the store webpage with dummy data. 

The technologies I used to build the shopping cart are: Material UI, ReactJS, React-Query, and TypeScript. 

This project is a part of a freecodecamp tutorial (Thomas Weibenfalk), but I have made several changes to make this project my own.
